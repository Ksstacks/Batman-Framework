Batman framework is used to scan the network for IP addresses, along with being able to reverse engineer the IP address. You can also use it to geo locate an IP address along with doing a trace-route on an IP. The script is written in python and is easy to edit and read. Don’t stray away from adding to it and I will keep updating the code the longer its up on GitHub
